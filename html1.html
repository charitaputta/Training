<tr>

<td><i>The cuisine of Andhra Pradesh belongs to the two
 Telugu-speaking regions of Rayalaseema and Coastal
 Andhra and is part of Telugu cuisine. The food of
 Andhra Pradesh is known for its heavy use of spices
 and, similar to South Indian cuisine, the use of tamarind. 
 Seafood is common in the coastal region of the state. 
 Rice is the staple food (as is with all South Indian states)
 eaten with lentil preparations like pappu (lentils) and Pulusu
 (Stew) and spicy vegetables or curries. </i> </td>

<tr>
<td><i>The staple food of Arunachal Pradesh is rice, along with
 fish, meat and leaf vegetables.[30] Many varieties of rice are
 used. Lettuce is the most common vegetable, usually prepared by 
 boiling with ginger, coriander and green chillies.[31] Boiled rice
 cakes wrapped in leaves are a popular snack. Thukpa is a kind of
 noodle soup common among the Monpa tribe of the region.[32]
 Native tribes of Arunachal are meat eaters and use fish, eggs,
 beef, chicken, pork and mutton to make their dishes.  </i> </td>

<tr>
<td><i>Assamese cuisine is a mixture of different indigenous 
styles, with considerable regional variation and some external 
influences. Although it is known for its limited use of spices,
[34] Assamese cuisine has strong flavours from its use of endemic
 herbs, fruits, and vegetables served fresh, dried or fermented. 
 Fish is widely eaten. Other Non-vegetarian items include chickens,
 ducks, pigeons, snails, silkworms, insects, mutton, pork, venison
 and turtle. The region's cuisine involves simple cooking processes,
 mostly barbecuing, steaming, boiling or fermenting.   </i> </td>
